Web application built on Play Framework used for viewing/searching mapping information of [MCP](http://mcp.ocean-labs.de) project.

It's a *work in progress*. It works, but it lacks a lot of functionality (and has some visual flaws). For example it doesn't support partial string search (e.g. "c" should find a class named "cc").

I wanted to run this on some free hosting, but MCP guys are ignoring me. I tried sending two e-mails (from different address, in case of spam filter; 2.1. 2014 and 21.1. 2014), both are unanswered to this very day. And I though MCP guys were nice :(.
