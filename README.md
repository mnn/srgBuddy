========

Web application built on Play Framework used for viewing/searching mapping information of [MCP](http://mcp.ocean-labs.de) project.

It's a *work in progress*. It works, but it lacks a lot of functionality (and has some visual flaws). For example it doesn't support partial string search (e.g. "c" should find a class named "cc").

In the future I'd like to run this on some free hosting, currently I'm waiting for a response from MCP guys (it's getting a bit long - over three weeks, I'm slowly losing hope :( ).
